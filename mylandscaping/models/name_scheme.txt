I got sick of overwriting the wrong files, here's the breakdown of the file names.

mylandscaping = name of mod, duh
*_block1 = block style
*_*_L = L, R, M, C, F [Left, Right, Middle, Corner, Full]
*_*_*_T = T, B [Top, Bottom]

Left block is leftmost in a wall
Right block is rightmost in a wall
Middle block is two full blocks, offset on top
Corner block is inside corner
Full block is full on bottom, and two halves on top, only takes up one node.

Columns don't follow same scheme, rather they use this.
mylandscaping = name of mod
*_column = can be extended in future to colum style
*_*_IC = IC, OC, M [Inside Corner, Outside Corner, Middle]
*_*_*_T = T, B [Top, Bottom]
